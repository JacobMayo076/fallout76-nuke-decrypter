# The purpose of this code is to solve nuclear lauch codes from the video game "Fallout 76", not to solve actual nuclear launch codes; that is highly illegal. The method used by the following code to decyrpt the silo launch codes was not created by me; I merely just took their approach and automated/put it in code form. This code is not to be used to gain monetary value, and I do not authorize anyone to do so.
